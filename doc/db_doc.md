# Database Documentation

## Introduction

We have decided to use Prisma as our orm. Prisma uses schemas to create a database and an interface for the code to
access the database, however this documentation will not be about prisma specifications, but about our database
structure. In case you have questions about Prisma itself, I'll gladly redirect you to the prisma docs:
